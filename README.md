Retinal vessel segmentation comparisons of the proposed GKD with previous knowledge distillation counterparts. 
The top two-row samples are from the CHASEDB1 dataset, the middle two-row samples are from the STARE dataset, and the bottom two-row samples are from the DRIVE dataset.
Notably, all the models are trained on the CHASEDB1 dataset and directly tested on the three testing sets.
# Code
We are organizing our code and will release the full version code soon. Sorry for the delay.
